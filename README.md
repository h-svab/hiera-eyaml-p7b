hiera-eyaml-p7b
===============

This is a plugin encryptor for the hiera-eyaml project (hosted https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml/).
It is a OpenSSL PKCS#7 encryptor like the original encryptor in hiera-eyaml but with the ability to use multiple keys.

Usage:

```
$ gem install hiera-eyaml-p7b
```

Then see hiera-eyaml documentation for how to use the eyaml tool to encrypt using the 'P7B' encryption_type.
